MarkaNow collects only anonymized location signals to compute crowdness and optionally stores short notes that users
choose to submit.

Data we process:
- Approximate location converted into an H3 cell ID at roughly 30-minute intervals, used solely for crowdness calculations.
- Optional notes supplied by the user; each note is attached to the H3 cell ID representing the area where it was written.

How we protect it:
- All location samples are transformed into H3 cell IDs before leaving the device; precise coordinates are never transmitted or stored.
- No account system or contact details are required to use the app or post notes.
- Only aggregated metrics are kept; raw samples are discarded after crowdness aggregation is complete.
