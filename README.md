## Frequently Asked Questions

### What does the Crowdness score mean?
Crowdness is a color-coded index showing how busy an area feels compared to its usual capacity. It is calculated from anonymized H3 cell activity that updates every 30 minutes.

### How often is the map updated?
The app ingests new anonymous pings every 30 minutes and smooths the data so that sudden spikes are handled gracefully.

### Why does the app ask for location access?
Crowdness depends on user participation. Allowing location access (preferably “Always Allow”) lets the app contribute anonymized cell updates that help the entire community.

### Does MarkaNow store personal information?
No. We never store precise coordinates or personal identifiers. All updates are aggregated into H3 cells before any data leaves your device.

### What information do local notes include?
Local notes are short, optional comments created by nearby users (for example, “Plenty of parking” or “Trail is muddy”). They do not contain usernames or contact details.

## Troubleshooting Tips
- **Map is blank**: Check your network connection and relaunch the app.
- **Location updates stop**: Re-open the app and confirm location permissions are still set to “Always Allow.”
- **Weather missing**: Weather data may be temporarily unavailable for certain regions. Try again in a few minutes.

If the issue persists, email us with your device model, iOS version, and a brief description of what happened.
